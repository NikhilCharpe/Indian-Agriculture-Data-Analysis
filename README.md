## 📊 Key Insights

📌 **Correlation Analysis**  
- Heatmap visualization of **Kharif Sorghum Area vs. Rabi Sorghum Area** shows a correlation coefficient of **0.21** → weak positive correlation.  

📌 **Crop Production Trends**  
- Trend analysis on **Wheat, Rice, Pulses, and Oilseeds** across districts.  
- Time-series visualizations reveal fluctuations in crop production over the years.  

📌 **Yield Efficiency Comparisons**  
- Comparison of yield trends across different states to identify **high vs low-performing regions**.
